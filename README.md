# FacialShield
FacialShield Unicauca 

A face shield that we developed. We evaluate through dozens of prototypes and  verification at CoVid laboratory.
We worked in reaction to the acute shortage of protective wear for medical personnel in the current CoVid19 situation, we have developed and started to evaluate protective face shields with medical people.

Main features:

- Based on prusa shield rc3 (most tested model).
- It does not use an elastic band that generates many problems due to contamination.
- Improvement that prevents shield foil from coming off.
- Fully sanitizable including adjustable strap.
- It has been validated by the Immunology Laboratory of the Faculty of Health Sciences of the Universidad del Cauca in charge of carrying out diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in the department of Cauca in Colombia.
