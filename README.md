# FacialShield
FacialShield Unicauca 

A prototype face shield that we developed. We evaluate through dozens of prototypes and  verifications at CoVid laboratories.
We worked in reaction to the acute shortage of protective wear for medical personnel in the current CoVid19 situation, we have developed and started to evaluate protective face shields with medical people.

Licence  of face shields
We share these files under non-commercial licence. It would be great if you donated these shields to those in need for free. If you need to cover your production costs, we are ok with you selling the shields for production cost.
